    <h1>What We Do</h1>
    <p>We steal debit/credit cards using RAT software which takes the victims information along with card details, phone number, email, IP, and his passwords. And then we sell those information such as his PayPal account, cash app, his cards, and many valuable information. We use an OTP bot to verify the card when it’s linked to an payment app such as PayPal then when it’s verified we withdraw the money into the account then pool the money into one account that, from there we can transfer those money to my costumers for example you purchase a low balance I will send 1500$ to you and then you’ll send back 500$ to my clothing brand website so we both make clean money and profit.
